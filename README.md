Building a Simple Interactive To-Do List
Follow the steps below to create a user-friendly task tracker.
Add a heading using <h1> with the text “Interactive To Do List”.
Create a list using the <ul> tag containing your to-do items.
Assign a default color (e.g., gray) to the list items. 
Add a tick/check icon on the right of each item, this icon should be hidden by default.
Implement an onClick event handler that:
Changes the color of the task (e.g., to green or blue).
Makes the tick icon visible to indicate completion.
The onClick handler should also allow toggling between the 'completed' and 'incomplete' state.
💡 Tip: Use JavaScript’s .classList.toggle() or inline styles to change colors and visibility dynamically.
